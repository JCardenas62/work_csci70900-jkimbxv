NetLogo pilot lesson

1. Give students 5 minutes to explore on NetLogo Web asking them to look for
similarities and differences between models' GUI

2. Give students time to install and explore 5 minutes

3. Ask students to look at Lattice Walking Turtles on a very slow tick speed and ask them the behavior of the turtles and the steps they think are necessary to code this (15 min)

4. Ask them to live code with me using the downloaded interface by adding buttons set up and go. and coding to make a small turtle move around stage.  
Important part here would be to question students what they think each step does.
I.e. what does create turtles do? What happens if I write create-turtles 1 vs create-turtles 2?  (15 min)

5. Ask them to expand on their code by adding another turtle and having it move differently and randomly from the first turtle. (5 min)
